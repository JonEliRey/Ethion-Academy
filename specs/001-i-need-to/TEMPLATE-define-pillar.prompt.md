# Define Pillar Workflow

You are guiding the Content Strategist agent through the process of defining a new educational pillar. This workflow ensures comprehensive demand analysis, clear scope definition, and alignment with project goals before moving to SME validation.

## Objective

Create a complete pillar specification document that includes:
- Pillar name and description
- Target audience analysis
- Demand justification (search volume, community questions, job market trends)
- Learning outcomes
- High-level topic coverage
- Proposed learning paths within the pillar
- Source material references

## Prerequisites

Before starting this workflow:
- [ ] Executive Producer has identified a general topic area to explore
- [ ] Access to demand signal tools (search trends, community forums, job boards)
- [ ] Access to official documentation sources for the technology

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Gather Context

Ask the Executive Producer:

1. **What is the general topic or technology area?**
   - Example: "DataOps", "Excel for Business", "Azure Synapse Analytics"

2. **What prompted this idea?**
   - Recent tool updates?
   - Community questions?
   - Job market demand?
   - Personal interest/expertise?

3. **Are there any constraints or preferences?**
   - Preferred learning path structure?
   - Target audience focus?
   - Content format preferences (video-first, blog-first, etc.)?

### Step 2: Demand Analysis

Research and document:

**Search Volume Analysis**:
- Use web search to check monthly search volume for key terms
- Identify trending vs. stable vs. declining interest
- Note seasonal patterns if relevant

**Community Signals**:
- Check Stack Overflow, Reddit, Microsoft Q&A for common questions
- Identify pain points and confusion areas
- Note frequency and recency of questions

**Job Market Demand**:
- Search job postings for skill requirements
- Identify which roles need this skill
- Note seniority levels (entry, mid, senior)

**Competitive Analysis**:
- Check what existing content is available (LinkedIn Learning, Pluralsight, YouTube)
- Identify gaps in existing content
- Note opportunities for differentiation

### Step 3: Define Pillar Scope

Based on demand analysis, create pillar specification:

**Pillar Name**:
- Clear, concise, searchable
- Example: "DataOps for Modern Data Teams"

**Description**:
- 2-3 sentences explaining what this pillar covers
- Who it's for
- Why it matters

**Target Audience**:
- Primary: Most important audience segment
- Secondary: Additional relevant audiences
- Required prerequisites

**Learning Outcomes**:
- What learners will be able to DO after completing this pillar
- Be specific and measurable
- Focus on practical skills

**High-Level Topics**:
- 5-10 major topic areas within this pillar
- Logical progression from foundational to advanced
- Note dependencies between topics

**Proposed Learning Paths**:
- 2-5 learning paths within this pillar
- Each path should have:
  - Name
  - Target sub-audience
  - Key topics covered
  - Estimated number of courses

### Step 4: Source Identification

Document authoritative sources:

**Official Documentation**:
- Microsoft Learn URLs
- Official product documentation
- Vendor-published guides

**Community Resources**:
- Reputable blogs (SQL.BI, PowerBI.Tips, GuyInACube)
- Industry standards and best practices
- Well-regarded community leaders

**Update Tracking**:
- Note how to monitor for changes
- RSS feeds, release notes, change logs
- Expected update frequency

### Step 5: Create Pillar Document

Generate a pillar specification file:

```markdown
---
title: "[Pillar Name]"
type: "pillar"
target_audience: ["Primary Audience", "Secondary Audience"]
topics: ["Topic1", "Topic2", "Topic3"]
status: "draft"
created_at: "[ISO 8601 timestamp]"
created_by: "content-strategist"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå **Too broad**: "Everything about Excel" - Not focused enough  
‚úÖ **Just right**: "Excel for Business Analysts: Data Analysis and Reporting"

‚ùå **Vague outcomes**: "Understand Power BI" - Not measurable  
‚úÖ **Specific**: "Create interactive dashboards with slicers and drill-through"

‚ùå **No demand data**: "This seems like a good topic" - No justification  
‚úÖ **Justified**: "500K monthly searches, 2K Stack Overflow questions, required in 70% of data analyst jobs"

‚ùå **Missing prerequisites**: Assuming all audiences start at same level  
‚úÖ **Clear requirements**: "Requires basic SQL knowledge and familiarity with data concepts"

## Tips for Success

1. **Be thorough in research**: Spend time understanding demand signals
2. **Think like a learner**: What would you need to know?
3. **Consider the journey**: How do topics build on each other?
4. **Stay current**: Check publication dates on sources
5. **Be realistic**: Can this content be created with available resources?
