# Plan Stage Quick Start

**You're ready to move to the Plan stage!** Here's how the documentation is organized:

---

## ðŸ“š Documentation Structure

### 1. **spec.md** *(READ FIRST)*
- Complete feature specification
- What we're building (meta-development system)
- All functional requirements
- **Start here to understand WHAT to build**

### 2. **CLARIFICATIONS.md**
- Q&A from clarification session
- All decisions and rationale
- MVP scope and phases
- **Reference for WHY decisions were made**

### 3. **META-DEVELOPMENT-SCOPE.md**
- Critical understanding: building agent system, not content
- Phase breakdown
- Success criteria
- **Understand the SCOPE before planning**

### 4. **PLAN-STAGE-INPUT.md** *(COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE)*
- **Complete input for plan stage**
- What the plan stage should produce
- Technical context (VS Code features)
- Reference materials (Fabric, Awesome Copilot, Beastmode)
- All 9 agent personas to design
- Database requirements
- Implementation constraints
- Success criteria
- **Use this as your main planning reference**

### 5. **Plan-information.md** *(TECHNICAL OVERVIEW)*
- Quick overview of VS Code Copilot features
- Custom instructions, chat modes, prompt files
- Links to reference materials
- **Technical capabilities available**

## ðŸŽ¯ What to Do Next

### For the Plan Stage

**Input Documents** (what you have):
- âœ… spec.md - Feature specification
- âœ… CLARIFICATIONS.md - Decisions made
- âœ… META-DEVELOPMENT-SCOPE.md - Scope clarity
- âœ… PLAN-STAGE-INPUT.md - Comprehensive planning guide
- âœ… Plan-information.md - Technical capabilities

**Expected Outputs** (what you'll produce):
1. **Technical Breakdown** - Architecture and design decisions
2. **9 Agent Specifications** - Detailed chat mode specs (using Fabric pattern structure)
3. **Workflow Diagrams** - Visual agent flow and stage gates
4. **Database Schema** - SQLite design for content tracking
5. **Handoff Protocol** - Exact mechanism for agent transitions
6. **Implementation Roadmap** - Phased approach with validation
7. **Example Scenarios** - Sample conversations showing agents in action
8. **Testing Plan** - Validation criteria per phase

**Recommended document structure**:
```
/docs/001-i-need-to/plan/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ technical-breakdown.md
â”œâ”€â”€ agents/ (9 agent specification files)
â”œâ”€â”€ workflows/ (diagrams and protocols)
â”œâ”€â”€ data/ (schema and queries)
â”œâ”€â”€ examples/ (conversation scenarios)
â”œâ”€â”€ implementation/ (roadmap and phases)
â””â”€â”€ testing/ (validation plan)
```

## ðŸš€ Starting the Plan Stage

### Step 1: Study Reference Materials
- Review Daniel Miessler's Fabric patterns (especially `analyze_tech_impact`, `create_summary`, `write_essay`)
- Check Beastmode chatmode for complex agent example
- Skim VS Code Copilot customization docs

### Step 2: Design First Agent
- Start with **Content Strategist** (foundation agent)
- Use Fabric pattern structure as template
- Define: role, instructions, inputs, outputs, handoffs
- Create chat mode specification

### Step 3: Design Handoff Protocol
- Define handoff message format
- Specify context passing mechanism
- Create handoff indicator examples

### Step 4: Continue with Remaining Agents
- SME, Librarian (complete Phase 1 agents)
- Then Scriptwriter, Editor, etc. (Phase 2 agents)
- Ensure consistency across all agents

### Step 5: Design Database & Workflows
- SQLite schema for content tracking
- Workflow diagrams showing agent interactions
- Stage-gate definitions

### Step 6: Create Example Scenarios
- Walk through complete workflows
- Show happy paths and rejection flows
- Demonstrate handoffs in action

### Step 7: Document Implementation Plan
- Phase 1: Foundation agents
- Phase 2: Production agents
- Phase 3: Validation (Excel pilot)
- Each phase with validation criteria

## âœ… Quality Checklist

Before moving to Build stage, verify:

- [ ] All 9 agents have complete specifications
- [ ] Agent specs follow Fabric pattern structure
- [ ] Handoff protocol is clearly documented
- [ ] Database schema covers all entities
- [ ] Workflow diagrams show complete flow
- [ ] Implementation roadmap is realistic
- [ ] Example scenarios demonstrate system working
- [ ] Testing plan validates each phase
- [ ] VS Code chat mode instructions are specific
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable

---

## ðŸŽ“ Remember

**You're designing the factory, not the products.**

The meta-development system (agent infrastructure) must be:
- **Clear**: Handoffs are unambiguous
- **Structured**: Based on proven patterns (Fabric)
- **Practical**: Implemented via VS Code chat modes
- **Validated**: Excel pilot proves it works

The better your plan, the smoother the implementation, and the more effective the content production system will be.

## ðŸ“ž Need Clarification?

If during planning you discover:
- Ambiguities in the spec
- Missing requirements
- Technical constraints not considered
- Implementation challenges

Document them and discuss with Executive Producer before proceeding.
