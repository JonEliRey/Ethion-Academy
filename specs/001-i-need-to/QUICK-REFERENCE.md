# Quick Reference: Critical Sequencing Rules

## üö® THE BIG THREE RULES

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE AGENTS
```
Wave 4 (T020-T022) ‚Üí Wave 5-6 (T011-T019)
```
**Why**: Agents reference `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` files  
**If broken**: All 9 agents have broken references, need rework  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ DATABASE SCHEMA BEFORE SCRIPTS
```
T008 ‚Üí T009-T010, T038-T040
```
**Why**: Scripts execute SQL against schema  
**If broken**: Scripts fail with "table not found"  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ VALIDATION BEFORE INTEGRATION
```
Wave 12 (T046-T048) ‚Üí Wave 13 (T049-T051)
```
**Why**: No point documenting broken features  
**If broken**: Integration guides reference unusable system

## üìã Pre-Flight Checklist

Before starting ANY wave, verify:

### Before Wave 5 (Phase 1 Agents):
- [ ] Wave 4 complete (ALL 3 custom instructions exist)
- [ ] `.github/instructions/global-standards.instructions.md` exists
- [ ] `.github/instructions/content-standards.instructions.md` exists
- [ ] `.github/instructions/handoff-protocol.instructions.md` exists

### Before Wave 8 (Workflow Docs):
- [ ] ALL 9 agents complete (T011-T019)
- [ ] Can load `@content-strategist` in VS Code chat
- [ ] Can load `@sme` in VS Code chat

### Before Wave 12 (Validation):
- [ ] Quickstart guide exists (T037)
- [ ] All configuration complete (Waves 4-7)
- [ ] Database initialized successfully

### Before Wave 13 (Integration):
- [ ] T046 passed (manual test)
- [ ] T047 passed (agent quality)
- [ ] T048 passed (database validation)
- [ ] No critical issues remain

## ‚ö° Speed Tips

### Maximum Parallelization Opportunities:
1. **Wave 1**: Run all 6 directory tasks simultaneously (~15 min ‚Üí 3 min)
2. **Wave 6**: Run all 6 Phase 2 agents simultaneously (~30 hrs ‚Üí 5-6 hrs)
3. **Wave 7**: Run all 8 prompts simultaneously (~32 hrs ‚Üí 4-6 hrs)

### Use AI Coding Assistants For:
- Agent chat mode creation (repetitive structure)
- Prompt file creation (similar formats)
- Template creation (parallel work)
- PowerShell scripts (boilerplate)

### Do Manually For:
- Database schema design (needs careful thought)
- Custom instructions (foundational, needs accuracy)
- Validation (human judgment required)
- Example scenarios (quality matters)

## üîç Gate Checklist

Copy this before each wave:

```markdown
## Gate: Entering Wave [#]

### Prerequisites Met:
- [ ] Previous wave complete
- [ ] All dependencies satisfied
- [ ] Required files exist
- [ ] No blocking issues

### Ready to Proceed:
- [ ] Understand wave goals
- [ ] Have templates/examples ready
- [ ] Time allocated (X hours)
- [ ] Validation plan clear

### After Wave Complete:
- [ ] All tasks done
- [ ] Gate criteria met
- [ ] Committed to Git
- [ ] Ready for next wave
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "Agent can't find custom instruction file"
**Problem**: Started Wave 5 before Wave 4 complete  
**Fix**: Complete T020-T022, then restart agent creation  

### "Database script fails"
**Problem**: Schema not tested before creating scripts  
**Fix**: Validate T008 with sample queries, fix schema, recreate scripts  

### "Validation fails at Wave 12"
**Problem**: Quality issues in earlier waves  
**Fix**: Identify root cause, return to relevant wave, fix, re-validate  

### "Example scenarios reference wrong format"
**Problem**: Created scenarios before workflow docs (T031)  
**Fix**: Review T031 (handoff protocol), update scenarios to match

## üìä Time Estimates by Role

### Solo Developer (doing everything):
- **With parallelization**: 18-22 hours (1-2 weeks part-time)
- **Sequential**: 32-44 hours (3-4 weeks part-time)

### With AI Coding Assistant:
- **Configuration tasks**: 50% faster (Waves 4-7)
- **Documentation**: 30% faster (Waves 8-10)
- **Validation**: Same time (human judgment)
- **Total**: ~15-18 hours (1 week part-time)

### Team of 2-3:
- **Wave 6** (6 agents): 2 hours instead of 6
- **Wave 7** (8 prompts): 2 hours instead of 6
- **Total**: ~12-15 hours (3-4 days part-time)
