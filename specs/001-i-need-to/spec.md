# Feature Specification: Super-Intelligent Course Designer Workflow

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-need-to`  
**Created**: 2025-09-26  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I need to create the super intelligent course designer workflow to build content for YouTube and Paid Learning Academy, in a strategic manner. Production shoud be in stages, starting from a high level pillars and discussing wiht the user to ensure alignment, before moving to the next level of detail. This shoudl fuction as a true learning development agency with multiple personas envolve.And the human as the Executive producer.

 The goal is that content woudl be produce for YouTube, blogs and eventually lead to paid subscribers. Youtube and blogs would serve as the start of a sales funnel which woudl eventually drive users to join the subcribtion portal. The structure of the content should be similar to what is done in other learning portals, for exampl:  modules, courses and learning paths, as done in LinkedIn Learning. This content should be highly relevant and up-to-date, about the current state of the tools as well as design the best learning experience for the users.

This course designer workflow should be able to help me build content that is well structure, and highly relevant to users. Also, as we produce subsquent content it shoudl help me keep track of what has been produce and refer to those items when necessary in future lessons. Additionally, it shoudl help me highlight when part of the content needs update due to updated tools or documentation.

Additionally, I would like the workflow to also help me produce content the distills the publication from official sites so I can explain it to the audience in simple terms and give them an idean of how this iterms apply to them. Thus making it simple for them to understand subjects that may be too complex and/or help them visualize (imagine) how this could help them."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As the Executive Producer, I want to develop a meta-development system (chatmode agents with instructions, prompts, and handoff indicators) that facilitates an agency-style, stage-gated workflow. This system collaborates with multiple AI agent personas to define high-level content pillars, then progressively elaborates into Learning Paths ‚Üí Courses ‚Üí Modules ‚Üí Lessons, producing aligned YouTube and blog assets that drive a funnel toward a paid subscription academy while staying current with tooling and community demand. **The deliverable is the working agent system itself, not the content** - content production begins only after the agent system is fully functional.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new initiative with broad goals, **When** the workflow proposes 3‚Äì7 high-level pillars and requests approval, **Then** the Executive Producer can approve/revise pillars before any deeper planning proceeds.
2. **Given** approved pillars, **When** the workflow drafts Learning Paths with course outlines and module themes, **Then** it pauses for approval and rationalizes each item with demand signals and citations.
3. **Given** approved paths/courses, **When** the workflow generates module lesson outlines plus YouTube video briefs and blog post briefs mapped to the funnel, **Then** each asset includes objectives, audiences, tags, and CTAs to the paid academy.
4. **Given** an official product update, **When** monitored sources indicate changes, **Then** the workflow flags affected lessons/assets, proposes updates, and references impacted sections.
5. **Given** previously produced content, **When** planning new lessons, **Then** the workflow cross-references existing assets and proposes reuse/links to avoid duplication and improve continuity.
6. **Given** any lesson outline, **When** the workflow finalizes lesson details, **Then** it includes a concise ‚ÄúLeader‚Äôs Lens‚Äù callout covering business outcome, decision criteria, risks/assumptions, and KPIs/measurement, written in plain language.
7. **Given** generated curriculum items (path, course, module, lesson), **When** reviewing their metadata, **Then** each declares its target audience segment (role √ó level) and prerequisite guidance, and aligns tags accordingly.

### Edge Cases
- Conflicting sources (official vs community) ‚Üí prefer latest official guidance; note discrepancies and date-stamp evidence.
- Scope creep at pillar/curriculum stages ‚Üí enforce stage gates; require approvals before proceeding.
- Insufficient demand signals ‚Üí mark as experimental and seek validation tasks before deep production.
- Rapidly changing tools ‚Üí warn when freshness window exceeded; schedule periodic review.
- Persona conflict or unclear ownership ‚Üí require role assignment before advancing.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST deliver a fully functional meta-development workflow consisting of: (a) chatmode agent definitions (personas with prompts and instructions), (b) handoff mechanisms indicating when the Executive Producer should switch between agents, (c) stage-gate approval checkpoints, and (d) content tracking/inventory capabilities. This system operates in stage gates: Pillars ‚Üí Learning Paths ‚Üí Courses ‚Üí Modules ‚Üí Lessons; each stage requires explicit Executive Producer approval before proceeding.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST implement multi-persona collaboration using AI agents (e.g., Content Strategist, SME, Scriptwriter, Editor, Community Manager, SEO/Distribution Lead, QA Reviewer, Librarian/Archivist, Monitoring Specialist) as chatmode configurations with role-specific prompts, instructions, and clear handoff indicators. The Executive Producer (human) manually switches between agent chatmodes to facilitate sequential interaction and is the sole approval authority at all stage gates. **Deliverable: Working agent system with all persona definitions and handoff logic, not the curriculum content itself.**
- **FR-003**: The workflow MUST gather and cite evidence from official documentation and reputable community sources to justify topic selection and maintain freshness.
- **FR-004**: The workflow MUST align assets to a sales funnel: top-of-funnel YouTube/blog content linking to mid/bottom-funnel academy modules and courses with clear CTAs. The paid subscription academy platform (Skool or similar) will be created after validating subscriber interest on YouTube and blog (EthionConsulting.com); content format and export requirements will be determined once platform is selected.
- **FR-005**: The workflow MUST produce structured curricula in the format Learning Paths > Courses > Modules > Lessons, consistent with the Constitution and similar to LinkedIn Learning‚Äôs structure.
- **FR-006**: The workflow MUST generate asset briefs/outlines for: YouTube videos (title, hook, outline, key visuals, embedded CTA performed by human), blog posts (title, summary, sections, keywords, embedded CTA), and academy lessons (objectives, outline, practice, references), without prescribing implementation details. The Executive Producer records YouTube videos; AI agents assist in producing blog posts from recorded videos. Asset production status tracking: brief ‚Üí recorded/drafted ‚Üí blog draft ‚Üí published.
- **FR-007**: The workflow MUST maintain a content inventory to track produced assets, canonical tags, and references for reuse in future lessons.
- **FR-008**: The workflow MUST detect when source tools/docs update and flag affected content with proposed revision notes and priority.
- **FR-009**: The workflow MUST apply consistent tagging at all levels (topic, level, audience/role, format, source type, tech/stack) to enable discovery across content.
- **FR-010**: The workflow MUST map each YouTube/blog asset to corresponding lessons/modules in the paid academy and record cross-links.
- **FR-011**: The workflow MUST distill publications from official sites into plain-language summaries with ‚Äúwhy it matters‚Äù and ‚Äúhow this applies‚Äù sections, including simple examples or visual analogies.
- **FR-012**: The workflow MUST provide approval checkpoints and change logs to maintain transparency and traceability.
- **FR-013**: The workflow SHOULD recommend a production cadence and prioritization based on demand signals and prerequisite dependencies. Primary success metrics: content accuracy and relevancy. Secondary metrics: YouTube engagement (views, watch time, comments) and search volume/demand signals. Target production cadence: minimum 4-6 lessons per month; ideal 2-3 lessons per week by recording long sessions that can be split into multiple lessons.
- **FR-014**: The workflow MUST export planning data in a machine-readable format (JSON or YAML) alongside human-readable summaries.
- **FR-015**: The workflow MUST avoid duplicating content by suggesting consolidation or references to existing assets where appropriate. Early content (e.g., Excel: Data Manipulation, Analysis, Power Query) serves as building blocks for subsequent lessons (e.g., Power BI Desktop), requiring robust prerequisite tracking and cross-referencing.
- **FR-023**: The workflow MUST organize all content in a hierarchical directory structure: `/pillars/{pillar-name}/learning-paths/{path-name}/courses/{course-name}/modules/{module-name}/lessons/{lesson-name}/`. Each directory MUST contain a README-style information file describing its purpose, scope, and contents.
- **FR-024**: Each content file (lesson, module, course, path, pillar) MUST include frontmatter metadata with: target audience (role √ó level), topics covered, learning goals/objectives, key takeaways/skills learned, prerequisites, tags, and content status.
- **FR-025**: After each lesson recording, the workflow MUST facilitate a post-lesson review to: (a) verify all planned topics were covered; (b) identify any unplanned topics that were addressed; (c) update lesson documentation and frontmatter to reflect actual content produced; (d) ensure synchronization between planned outlines and recorded video content.
- **FR-026**: MVP scope focuses on **building the agent system**, not content production. Phase 1 creates chatmode agent definitions, prompts, and handoff mechanisms for the Pillars ‚Üí Learning Paths stages. Phase 2 extends the agent system to handle Courses ‚Üí Modules ‚Üí Lessons stages. Phase 3 validates the complete system by piloting it with one foundational Learning Path (Excel: Data Manipulation, Data Analysis, and Automation with Power Query) to verify all agents and handoffs work correctly. **No content production begins until the agent system is fully functional.**
- **FR-027**: The system MUST provide clear handoff indicators that signal when the Executive Producer should switch from one agent persona to another. Handoff indicators MUST include: (a) which agent is completing their work, (b) which agent should take over next, (c) what input/context the next agent needs, (d) what deliverable is expected from the next agent, and (e) when to return to the Executive Producer for approval/decision.
- **FR-016**: The workflow MUST store the content inventory in a Git-committed SQLite database at `content-inventory/content.db`, and output machine-readable exports in `content-inventory/exports/` as JSON/YAML; optionally generate read-only Markdown mirrors for Obsidian. Expected scale: dozens to 100+ lessons over the initial phase. Access: human Executive Producer and AI agents via sequential processing (no concurrent write conflicts initially).
- **FR-017**: The workflow MUST use GitHub Projects for stage-gated reviews and notifications: create a Draft PR per stage (Pillars ‚Üí Paths ‚Üí Courses ‚Üí Modules ‚Üí Lessons), associate it to a single Project per pillar (e.g., all DataOps content in one project), apply stage labels to route cards across columns, request Executive Producer review (sole approver), and treat PR approval as the gate to advance the card to the next column/stage. Rejected content returns to the previous stage for rework and re-review.
- **FR-018**: The workflow MUST use a hybrid monitoring cadence: (a) weekly light scan of official sources and key community channels for major changes; (b) monthly comprehensive review of active curricula and assets; and (c) near‚Äëreal‚Äëtime alerts from official product/update feeds to immediately flag material changes. It MUST enforce a freshness SLA: fast‚Äëchanging stacks reviewed at least every 90 days and slower‚Äëchanging content at least every 180 days; SLA breaches auto-create review tickets. Official sources include: Microsoft Docs, Microsoft Learn, Microsoft Fabric Blog, Excel Blog, Power BI Blog, official Microsoft YouTube channel, and authoritative community sources (SQL.BI, PowerBI.Tips, GuyInACube, etc.). Material changes include: major tool improvements changing workflows, deprecation announcements, updates contradicting prior guidance, and brand new capabilities creating alternative approaches. A specialized Monitoring Specialist agent reviews alerts, then discusses findings with the Executive Producer for action decisions.
- **FR-019**: The workflow MUST define target audiences via a hybrid segmentation matrix (role √ó level). Initial priority segments are: (1) Data/Business Analyst ‚Äî Beginner; (2) Software/Automation Engineer ‚Äî Intermediate; with the next planned segment being (3) Manager/Leader ‚Äî Intermediate. All curriculum items MUST declare their target segment(s) and recommended prerequisites; tags MUST include both role and level.
- **FR-022**: Each lesson MUST include a ‚ÄúLeader‚Äôs Lens‚Äù section (90‚Äì150 words) that articulates: (a) business value and intended outcomes, (b) key decisions and trade-offs, (c) risks/assumptions and change-management notes, and (d) suggested KPIs/OKRs to track impact. This content SHOULD avoid jargon and be understandable by non-technical stakeholders.
 - **FR-021**: Governance (Moderate):
    - Retention: keep drafts and derivative working data for 24 months; keep published exports (academy/public) and code indefinitely; allow optional archives for audits.
    - Access: enforce least-privilege repo roles; protect branches for stage gates; prohibit secrets/PII in repo; require reviewer approval on sensitive changes.
    - Licensing: MIT for code/scripts/schemas/templates; CC BY 4.0 for public blog/YouTube content; CC BY‚ÄëNC 4.0 for paid academy content; diagrams/Obsidian mirrors inherit the source content license; always paraphrase and cite third-party sources; brief quotes only under fair use.
 - **FR-020**: The workflow MUST follow a hybrid SEO strategy: define global topic clusters and pillar pages aligned to pillars/learning paths, select keywords via data-driven analysis (difficulty/volume, competitor gaps), refresh clusters quarterly, and add geo-variant targeting (e.g., en-US, en-UK) only for high-impact assets based on analytics. Each public asset brief MUST list 3‚Äì10 primary/secondary keywords and the owning cluster.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Persona/Agent**: AI chatmode configuration with role-specific prompts, instructions, and responsibilities (e.g., Content Strategist, SME, Scriptwriter, Monitoring Specialist). Each agent includes handoff logic. Executive Producer is the human with sole approval authority who switches between agent chatmodes.

## Integration Notes (optional)

- Obsidian: Keep SQLite as the canonical store. Optionally export read-only Markdown notes (with frontmatter tags and wikilinks) under `content-inventory/obsidian/` to enable Obsidian graph view and Dataview tables. If preferred, use a community SQLite query plugin in Obsidian to read `content.db` directly.
- Graph DB (Neo4j): Provide periodic ETL from SQLite to Neo4j (via CSV or JSON). Suggested nodes: Persona, Pillar, LearningPath, Course, Module, Lesson, ContentAsset, Source, DemandSignal, Tag, Approval, UpdateAlert. Suggested relationships: PILLAR_HAS_PATH, PATH_HAS_COURSE, COURSE_HAS_MODULE, MODULE_HAS_LESSON, ASSET_ALIGNS_WITH_LESSON|MODULE, LESSON_REFERENCES_SOURCE, ITEM_HAS_TAG, ITEM_HAS_DEMAND_SIGNAL, ITEM_APPROVED_BY, ITEM_FLAGGED_BY_UPDATEALERT, ASSET_DRIVES_TO_COURSE|PATH.
 - Monitoring details: Weekly scan sources include official docs/changelogs, product blogs, release notes, major community forums, and top YouTube channels. Real-time alerts via RSS/API/webhooks from official products. SLA tiering: mark content as Fast or Standard; auto-create tickets when review due and include an impact map listing potentially affected lessons/modules.
- GitHub Projects flow: One Project per pillar with columns matching stage gates. Each stage creates/updates a Draft PR linked to a card. Required reviewer: Executive Producer (sole approver). Labels: `stage/pillars`, `stage/paths`, `stage/courses`, `stage/modules`, `stage/lessons`. Approval merges or promotes to next column; rejections add a comment and move card back to previous stage for rework.
- MVP and Initial Content: Phase 1 develops Pillars and Learning Paths. Phase 2 selects Excel (Data Manipulation, Data Analysis, Automation/Power Query) as the foundational path and develops it completely to establish templates. Excel content serves as building blocks for subsequent Power BI Desktop and related lessons.
- Directory Structure: All content organized as `/pillars/{pillar}/learning-paths/{path}/courses/{course}/modules/{module}/lessons/{lesson}/`. Each directory includes README with description. All content files include frontmatter: target audience, topics, goals, takeaways, prerequisites, tags, status.
- Post-Recording Alignment: After each video recording, conduct review to verify planned topics were covered, identify unplanned topics, and update documentation/frontmatter to match actual recorded content for synchronization.
 - Audience & tags: Curriculum items should set tags: `role:<analyst|engineer|manager>` and `level:<beginner|intermediate|advanced>` in addition to topic/format/source-type per Constitution.
 - Governance notes: Add LICENSE files or headers per asset type (MIT for code; CC BY for public content; CC BY‚ÄëNC for academy). Include portal Terms of Use clarifying Noncommercial scope. Provide a takedown path for accidental inclusion of third‚Äëparty proprietary content.
 - SEO notes: Maintain `seo/clusters.yaml` mapping pillars/paths to clusters. Asset briefs must include target SERP intent, internal links to pillar pages and related modules, and notes for geo-variant localization when enabled. Re-evaluate clusters quarterly and after major product releases.
