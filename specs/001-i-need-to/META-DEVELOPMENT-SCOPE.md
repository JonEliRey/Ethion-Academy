# Meta-Development Scope

**Critical Understanding**: This feature builds the **agent system itself**, not the content.

## What We're Building

This project develops the **meta-development layer** - the infrastructure and agent configurations that will enable content production:

### Deliverables (The Agent System)

1. **Chatmode Agent Definitions**
   - Role-specific prompts for each persona
   - Instructions and context for each agent
   - Responsibilities and boundaries
   - Examples and templates

2. **Handoff Mechanisms**
   - Clear indicators when to switch agents
   - Context passing between agents
   - Input/output specifications
   - Return-to-human decision points

3. **Stage-Gate Controls**
   - Approval checkpoint definitions
   - Review criteria per stage
   - Rejection/rework flows
   - Progress tracking

4. **Content Tracking System**
   - SQLite schema for content inventory
   - Tagging and metadata standards
   - Cross-reference tracking
   - Prerequisite mapping

### Agent Personas to Implement

Each needs:
- System prompt/instructions
- Role description
- Input requirements
- Output format
- Handoff conditions
- Example interactions

**Agents:**
1. Content Strategist
2. Subject Matter Expert (SME)
3. Scriptwriter
4. Editor
5. Community Manager
6. SEO/Distribution Lead
7. QA Reviewer
8. Librarian/Archivist
9. Monitoring Specialist

## What We're NOT Building (Yet)

- ❌ Actual curriculum content (pillars, paths, courses, modules, lessons)
- ❌ YouTube videos or blog posts
- ❌ The paid academy platform
- ❌ Published learning materials

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Agents (Pillars → Learning Paths)
**Goal**: Build agents needed for high-level planning

- Content Strategist (demand analysis, pillar definition)
- SME (topic validation, structure recommendations)
- Librarian/Archivist (tracking setup, taxonomy design)
- Handoff indicators for these three agents
- Basic SQLite schema

**Validation**: Can these agents collaborate to propose and approve pillars and learning paths?

### Phase 2: Production Agents (Courses → Modules → Lessons)
**Goal**: Build agents for detailed content development

- Scriptwriter (lesson outlines, video briefs)
- Editor (quality review, consistency)
- SEO/Distribution Lead (keywords, funnel mapping)
- QA Reviewer (accuracy, completeness)
- Community Manager (engagement strategy)
- Monitoring Specialist (freshness tracking)
- Enhanced handoff indicators
- Complete SQLite schema

**Validation**: Can the full agent system develop detailed lesson plans and asset briefs?

### Phase 3: System Validation
**Goal**: Test complete agent system end-to-end

- Pilot with ONE learning path: Excel (Data Manipulation, Analysis, Power Query)
- Exercise all agents through all stages
- Refine handoffs based on real usage
- Document any gaps or friction points
- Iterate until system works smoothly

**Success Criteria**: Executive Producer can use the agent system to go from idea → production-ready briefs with clear, efficient agent collaboration

### Phase 4: Content Production (Post-Agent-System)
**Goal**: Use the proven agent system to create actual content

- Now we start producing real curriculum
- Build out full DataOps pillar
- Create YouTube videos and blog posts
- Populate the content inventory
- Track prerequisites and building blocks

## Key Distinction

**Current Scope (This Feature)**: Building the factory
**Future Scope (Next Feature)**: Using the factory to make products

We're creating the **tooling and processes** (meta-development) that will enable efficient, high-quality content creation. Once the agent system works, content production becomes the next project.

## Success Metric for THIS Feature

The agent system is ready when:

✅ All 9 agent personas have defined prompts and instructions
✅ Handoff indicators clearly signal when to switch agents
✅ Stage-gate approval flows are implemented
✅ Content inventory tracking works
✅ The pilot (Excel path) validates the entire system
✅ Executive Producer can smoothly navigate agent-to-agent workflow
✅ No ambiguity about which agent to use or when to switch

## Next Steps After This Feature

Once the agent system is validated:

1. Create new feature: "Develop DataOps Pillar Content"
2. Use the proven agent system to produce actual curriculum
3. Record videos, write blogs, build courses
4. Populate the academy (when platform is ready)
5. Iterate on content based on user feedback

---

**Remember**: We're building the **how** (the system), not the **what** (the content). The system must be fully functional before content production begins.
