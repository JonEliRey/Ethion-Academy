# Plan Stage Input Document

**Purpose**: This document provides all necessary context, constraints, and resources for the Plan stage to develop a comprehensive technical breakdown and implementation plan for the Super-Intelligent Course Designer meta-development system.

---

## üìã What to Read First

### Core Specification Documents
1. **spec.md** - Complete feature specification (WHAT we're building)
2. **CLARIFICATIONS.md** - Detailed Q&A and decisions made
3. **META-DEVELOPMENT-SCOPE.md** - Critical understanding that we're building the agent system, not content

### Key Understanding
**We are building a meta-development system** - the agent infrastructure (chatmodes, prompts, handoffs) that will enable content production. This is NOT about producing curriculum content; it's about building the factory that will produce content later.

---

## üéØ What the Plan Stage Should Produce

Your deliverables should include:

1. **Technical Breakdown** - Architecture and design decisions
2. **Agent Specifications** - Detailed specs for all 9 agent personas
3. **Workflow Diagrams** - Visual representation of agent interactions and handoffs
4. **Database Schema** - SQLite structure for content tracking
5. **Implementation Roadmap** - Phased approach with validation criteria
6. **Handoff Protocol** - Exact mechanism for agent transitions
7. **Example Scenarios** - Sample conversations showing agents in action
8. **Testing & Validation Plan** - How to verify system works

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Context: VS Code Copilot Customization

The implementation will use VS Code's Copilot customization features to create the agent system.

### Custom Instructions
**What they are**: Markdown files defining guidelines/rules for tasks like code generation, reviews, or commit messages.

**How we'll use them**: 
- Define global coding standards for the project
- Set review criteria for agent-generated content
- Establish commit message and PR conventions
- Provide project-specific context that all agents should know

**Documentation**: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/custom-instructions

**Example use cases for our project**:
- "All content files must include frontmatter with target audience, topics, goals, prerequisites"
- "Database operations must use parameterized queries"
- "All agent handoffs must include context summary and expected output"

---

### Chat Modes
**What they are**: Specialist assistants for specific roles/tasks, defined in Markdown files with scope, capabilities, tool access, and preferred language model.

**How we'll use them**:
- **Each of our 9 agent personas will be a chat mode**
- Content Strategist chat mode with research capabilities
- SME chat mode with technical validation focus
- Scriptwriter chat mode with creative writing emphasis
- Librarian chat mode with database access
- etc.

**Documentation**: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/custom-chat-modes

**Key capabilities**:
- Define scope and boundaries per agent
- Specify which tools each agent can access (read-only, database, web search, etc.)
- Set preferred language model per agent (some may need more powerful models)
- Include role-specific instructions and examples

**Chat mode file structure** (based on Beastmode example):
```markdown
---
description: Content Strategist
tools: ['fetch', 'search', 'codebase']
---

# Content Strategist

[Main content with detailed instructions]

## Role
Demand analysis and strategic content planning

## Workflow
1. [Step-by-step instructions]
2. [...]

## Guidelines
[Specific guidelines for this agent]

## Handoff Protocol
[When to handoff to other agents]
```

**Important**: 
- YAML frontmatter with `---` delimiters goes at the BEGINNING of the file
- Files stored in `.github/chatmodes/` directory
- File naming: `agent-name.chatmode.md` (e.g., `content-strategist.chatmode.md`)

---

### Prompt Files
**What they are**: Reusable prompts for common/repeatable tasks, defined in Markdown files and runnable directly in chat.

**How we'll use them**:
- Create repeatable workflows for each stage (define pillars, define paths, etc.)
- Standard templates for asset briefs (YouTube video, blog post, lesson)
- Content review checklists
- Handoff templates

**Documentation**: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/prompt-files

**Prompt file structure** (with frontmatter at beginning):
```markdown
---
mode: 'content-strategist'
description: 'Guide Content Strategist through pillar creation'
tools: ['search', 'fetch', 'codebase']
---

# Define Pillar Workflow

[Detailed instructions and steps]
```

**Example prompt files for our project** (stored in `.vscode/prompts/`):
- `define-pillar.prompt.md` - Walks Content Strategist through pillar creation (mode: 'content-strategist')

## üîÑ Critical: Handoff Mechanism Design

The plan stage MUST design a clear, unambiguous handoff mechanism. This is the most critical component of the meta-development system.

### Handoff Requirements
Each agent handoff must include:

1. **Clear Signal**: Unmistakable indicator that handoff is occurring
2. **Source Agent**: Which agent is handing off
3. **Target Agent**: Which agent should take over
4. **Context Summary**: What work was completed
5. **Deliverables**: What artifacts are being passed
6. **Input Needed**: What the next agent needs to begin
7. **Expected Output**: What the next agent should produce
8. **Success Criteria**: How to know the next agent succeeded
9. **Return Condition**: When to come back to Executive Producer

### Example Handoff Format to Define
```markdown
## üîÑ HANDOFF REQUIRED

**From**: Content Strategist
**To**: Subject Matter Expert (SME)
**Reason**: Pillar definition needs technical validation

### Context
I've analyzed demand signals and proposed 3 pillars for the DataOps domain:
1. Data Fundamentals (Excel, Power Query)
2. Business Intelligence (Power BI Desktop)
3. Advanced Analytics (DAX, Data Modeling)

### Deliverables Attached
- Pillar definitions with rationale
- Demand signal evidence
- Proposed audience segments

### What SME Should Do
- Validate technical scope of each pillar
- Assess complexity and sequencing
- Identify prerequisites between pillars
- Recommend any adjustments

### Expected Output
- Technical validation report
- Recommended pillar order
- Prerequisite map
- Approval or revision suggestions

### Success Criteria
- All pillars have technical assessment
- Sequencing is logical based on prerequisites
- Scope is achievable within constraints

**Executive Producer**: Please switch to SME chat mode and provide the attached context.
```

## üìä Database Design Requirements

The plan stage should design the SQLite schema for content tracking. Consider:

### Core Entities
- Pillars, Learning Paths, Courses, Modules, Lessons
- Content Assets (YouTube, Blog, Academy)
- Tags (topic, level, audience, format, tech/stack, prerequisites)
- Sources/Citations
- Demand Signals
- Agent Actions (audit trail)
- Approval Records
- Update Alerts

### Key Relationships
- Hierarchical: Pillar ‚Üí Path ‚Üí Course ‚Üí Module ‚Üí Lesson
- Cross-references: Lesson ‚Üí Prerequisites (other lessons)
- Mappings: Asset ‚Üí Lesson (YouTube video maps to lesson)
- Tracking: Content ‚Üí Tags, Content ‚Üí Sources, Content ‚Üí Approvals

### Query Patterns
- Find all content needing review (freshness SLA)
- Get prerequisites for a lesson
- List content by tag/audience
- Track agent activity
- Audit approval history

---
