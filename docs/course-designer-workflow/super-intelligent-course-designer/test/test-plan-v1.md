# Test Plan v1 (skeleton)

Scope
- Validate stage gates and approvals
- Validate tagging completeness and schema keys
- Validate monitoring alerts and SLA ticket creation

Tests
- Happy path: Pillars → Paths → Courses → Modules → Lessons approved
- Edge: conflicting sources flagged; freshness breach creates ticket
