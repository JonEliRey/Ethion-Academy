# Project Plan (skeleton)

## GitHub Project Configuration
- Project board: columns match stage gates
- Labels: stage/pillars, stage/paths, stage/courses, stage/modules, stage/lessons
- Required reviewers: Executive Producer + SME
- Definition of Done: as per Constitution
- Custom fields configuration: See `.github/projects.yml` for field definitions and options

## Important Notes
- **Expertise Level** field must use correct spellings: "Beginner", "Intermediate", "Advanced"
- Avoid typos: ~~"Begginer"~~ → "Beginner", ~~"Advance"~~ → "Advanced"
- All field options must match those defined in `.github/projects.yml` for consistency
