# Content Creation Workflows

This directory contains step-by-step workflows for creating and managing content in Ethion Academy.

## Available Workflows

### Phase 1 (MVP)
- **[pillar-workflow.md](pillar-workflow.md)** - Complete workflow for creating a new content pillar (demand analysis → validation → cataloging)

### Future Workflows
- Learning path creation (Phase 2)
- Course development (Phase 2)
- Lesson scripting (Phase 3)
- Content updates and maintenance (Phase 3)

## How to Use These Workflows

1. **Start with pillar-workflow.md** for your first content initiative
2. Follow each step sequentially
3. Use the referenced agents (`@content-strategist`, `@sme`, `@librarian`) at appropriate stages
4. Document any pain points or suggestions for improvement

## Workflow Evolution

These workflows will be refined based on actual usage during content pilots. See `docs/decisions/` for notes on what's working and what needs adjustment.
