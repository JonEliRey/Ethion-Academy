# Archive: 2025 Implementation Planning Documents

**Date Archived:** November 2025

## Purpose

This directory contains planning documents from the initial meta-development phase of Ethion Academy. These documents were created during the design and architecture phase when the workspace structure was being defined.

## What's Archived

- **Plan-information.md** - Context and specifications for the planning stage, including custom instructions and chat mode structure guidelines

## Why Archived

These documents served their purpose during the design phase but are no longer needed for daily operations. The workspace has been simplified to focus on content creation rather than meta-development.

## When to Reference These Docs

- **Historical Context:** Understanding why certain design decisions were made
- **Architecture Review:** Revisiting the original vision before making structural changes
- **Troubleshooting:** Investigating legacy patterns or naming conventions

## Current Alternatives

Instead of these archived planning docs, use:
- **[WORKSPACE_MAP.md](../../../WORKSPACE_MAP.md)** - Current workspace structure
- **[AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md)** - Active agent roster and conventions
- **[docs/workflows/](../../workflows/)** - Current operational workflows
