# Archive

This directory stores legacy documents that remain useful for historical context but are no longer part of the active course designer workflow.

- Files are grouped by feature or initiative (for example, `course-designer-workflow/`).
- Keep filenames descriptive so it is clear what the document covers without opening it.
- Update cross-references when moving files here so readers can still locate relevant material from the live documentation set.
