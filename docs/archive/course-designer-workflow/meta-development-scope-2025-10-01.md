# Meta-Development Scope (Archived)

**Date**: October 1, 2025  
**Feature**: Super-Intelligent Course Designer Workflow  
**Branch**: `001-i-need-to`

> **Status**: Archived for historical transparency. The scope is now articulated in `docs/001-i-need-to/plan/agent-context-update.md`, `docs/001-i-need-to/plan/workflows/agent-flow.md`, and `docs/001-i-need-to/plan/stage-gates.md`.

## Original Scope Statement
- Build a **course designer workflow** functioning like a learning development agency.
- Support multi-persona collaboration with the human Executive Producer overseeing approvals.
- Organize production in stages: high-level pillars → detailed lessons.
- Ensure content is suitable for YouTube, blogs, and a future subscription portal.
- Track content inventory, monitor for updates, and flag stale material.

## Reframed Understanding
- Actual **content production** is out of scope for this feature.
- Focus is on building the **system** (agents, prompts, handoffs, validation, monitoring, storage).
- Executive Producer interacts with AI agents to steer production planning.

## Key Deliverables (Legacy)
1. Persona definitions and responsibilities
2. Stage progression from Pillars to Lessons
3. Inventory tracking and update alerts
4. Content repurposing guidance (YouTube ↔ Blog ↔ Paid portal)
5. Monitoring plan for official documentation sources

## Superseding Context

- `docs/001-i-need-to/governance/github-project-setup.md`

## Notes
- Retained to show how the plan evolved from content-focused outputs to system-focused outputs.
- Provides legacy context when reviewing past decisions or requirements discussions.
