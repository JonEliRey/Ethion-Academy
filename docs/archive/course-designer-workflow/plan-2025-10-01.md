# Feature Plan (Archived)

**Date**: October 1, 2025  
**Feature**: Super-Intelligent Course Designer Workflow  
**Branch**: `001-i-need-to`

> **Status**: Archived. Superseded by updated plan artifacts in `docs/001-i-need-to/plan/` aligned with the stage-gate workflow and clarified meta-development scope.

## Legacy Summary
The original plan outlined how a multi-agent system would collaborate to produce curriculum content across YouTube, blogs, and a future subscription portal. It mixed system-building tasks with production tasks, which created confusion about scope and deliverables.

## Structure (Historical)
1. **Vision & Goals**
   - Function as an end-to-end learning development agency
   - Establish personas and collaboration guidelines
   - Produce multi-format content (video, blog, premium)

2. **Personas & Responsibilities**
   - Content Strategist, SME, Scriptwriter, Editor, SEO Lead, Community Manager, QA Reviewer, Monitoring Specialist, Librarian/Archivist, Executive Producer (human)

3. **Workflow Phases**
   - Pillars → Learning Paths → Courses → Modules → Lessons → Publication → Monitoring

4. **Tooling & Integrations**
   - GitHub Projects for kanban & stage tracking
   - SQLite inventory for content assets
   - Monitoring touchpoints with official documentation

5. **Measurement & Success Metrics**
   - Content accuracy, engagement, subscriber growth

6. **Risks & Mitigations**
   - Keep documentation current, guard against outdated instructions

## Reason for Archival
- The plan intermingled **meta-development** with **content production**, conflicting with clarified scope.
- Stage-gate documentation now drives the process.
- Agent responsibilities are defined in dedicated instruction files.
- Success metrics are captured separately in the validation checklist.
