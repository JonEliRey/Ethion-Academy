# Corrections to Meta-Development Plan

**Date**: October 1, 2025  
**Feature**: Super-Intelligent Course Designer Workflow  
**Branch**: `001-i-need-to`

## Corrected Understanding

### 1. Scope Clarification
- The plan focuses exclusively on **meta-development** (building the workflow system), **not** on producing actual curriculum content.  
- All references to creating course material, YouTube videos, or blogs are out-of-scope for this feature and are now removed from plan documentation.

### 2. Output Expectations
- Deliverables are **agent prompts**, **instruction sets**, **stage-gate definitions**, **handoff cues**, **tracking schemas**, and **validation tools**—not learning content.
- Documentation now emphasizes systems, workflows, governance, and validation tooling.

### 3. Personas & Agents
- Personas are **AI agents**, each with specific prompts/instructions.  
- Executive Producer (Jonathan Reyes) remains the **human decision-maker**.  
- The plan is updated to highlight this human-in-the-loop role at every approval stage.

### 4. Content Monitoring & Freshness
- A **Monitoring Specialist agent** is responsible for tracking third-party changes and notifying the team.  
- Updated documentation clarifies scope and responsibilities for ongoing content freshness.

### 5. Documentation Adjustments
- Removed or relocated sections that described content production deliverables.  
- Added clear framing that the plan is about infrastructure and process to deliver future content.

### 6. Stage-Gate Process
- Stage gates focus on verifying readiness of agent prompts, workflow scripts, handoff cues, and tracking mechanisms.  
- Updated acceptance criteria to reference meta-system milestones instead of content artifacts.

## Files Updated as Part of Corrections
- `spec.md`: Clarified meta-development scope and deliverables.  
- `plan.md`: Removed content-production activities, added meta-development milestones.  
- `research.md`: Reframed as meta-development research (agent best practices, monitoring tools).  
- `tasks.md`: Replaced content production tasks with system-building tasks.  
- `quickstart.md`: Updated to show how to operate the agent workflow, not how to create lessons.  
- `INPUT-VS-OUTPUT.md`: Adjusted expected inputs/outputs to meta-development artifacts.

## Next Steps
- Review all dependent documents (prompts, stage gates, validation checklist) to ensure they reference meta-development scope.
- Communicate changes to stakeholders so future work requests reference the correct understanding.
