# Execution Sequence (Retired)

**Date**: October 1, 2025  
**Feature**: Super-Intelligent Course Designer Workflow (Meta-Development)  
**Branch**: `001-i-need-to`

> **Status**: Archived. Superseded by the stage-gate workflow documented in `docs/001-i-need-to/plan/stage-gates.md` and related agent handoff protocols.

## Overview
This document captured the initial execution sequence drafted for the course designer workflow before the process was restructured around stage gates and agent handoffs. It remains archived for historical context.

## Original Phases

### Phase 0: Alignment & Setup
- Confirmed meta-development scope
- Identified personas and their responsibilities
- Outlined knowledge base and monitoring requirements

### Phase 1: Pillars
- Persona: Content Strategist
- Activities: Identify high-level pillars, validate with Executive Producer

### Phase 2: Learning Paths
- Persona: Content Strategist → SME handoff
- Activities: Expand pillars into learning paths, define target outcomes

### Phase 3: Courses
- Persona: SME → Scriptwriter handoff
- Activities: Outline course structure, module objectives

### Phase 4: Modules
- Persona: Scriptwriter → Editor handoff
- Activities: Draft lesson briefs, identify required assets, align on CTA strategy

### Phase 5: Production
- Persona: Executive Producer (human) with support from Editor and QA Reviewer
- Activities: Record videos, create blog drafts, perform reviews

### Phase 6: Publication & Promotion
- Persona: SEO/Distribution Lead, Community Manager
- Activities: Publish content, manage CTAs, engage community

### Phase 7: Monitoring & Maintenance
- Persona: Monitoring Specialist, Librarian/Archivist
- Activities: Track source updates, trigger refresh workflows, maintain inventory

## Why This Was Archived
- The team adopted the Stage-Gate workflow as a clearer, more rigorous governance model.
- Agent roles and handoffs are now defined per stage gate rather than sequential phases.
- Monitoring, knowledge retention, and content reminders are handled via the new SQLite schema and Librarian/Archivist responsibilities.
