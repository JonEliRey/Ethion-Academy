# Inputs vs Outputs (Retired)

**Date**: October 1, 2025  
**Feature**: Super-Intelligent Course Designer Workflow  
**Branch**: `001-i-need-to`

> **Status**: Archived. The canonical definition of inputs and outputs now lives in the stage-gate checklists and agent prompts. This file remains for historical reference.

## Historical Context
The original documentation attempted to define inputs and outputs for each stage of content development (pillars → learning paths → courses → modules → lessons). After the shift to meta-development, these definitions were reworked to focus on system artifacts rather than content deliverables.

## Original Intent
- **Inputs**: Research briefs, persona insights, audience pain points, tool updates
- **Outputs**: Pillar briefs, learning paths, course outlines, module lesson briefs, CTA plan, blog drafts, video scripts

## Superseding Sources
- `docs/001-i-need-to/plan/stage-gates.md`
- `docs/001-i-need-to/plan/workflows/agent-flow.md`
- Agent prompt definitions under `docs/001-i-need-to/plan/agents/`

## Notes
- Content production outputs are now considered separate features, triggered after this meta-development system is fully validated.
- Future content-focused features should create fresh Input/Output documents aligned with the production scope.
