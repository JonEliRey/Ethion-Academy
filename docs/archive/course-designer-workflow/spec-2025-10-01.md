# Feature Specification (Archived)

**Date**: October 1, 2025  
**Feature**: Super-Intelligent Course Designer Workflow  
**Branch**: `001-i-need-to`

> **Status**: Archived. The authoritative specification has moved to the stage-gate driven documentation under `docs/001-i-need-to/plan/`.

## Legacy Overview
This specification defined requirements for a multi-agent workflow intended to behave like a learning development agency. It encompassed both meta-development (system setup) and content production (actual lessons/articles).

### Core Goals (Historical)
1. Structure content production from high-level pillars down to individual lessons.
2. Coordinate multiple AI personas with the human Executive Producer overseeing approvals.
3. Generate content for YouTube, blogs, and a paid learning portal.
4. Track content freshness and trigger updates when tool documentation changes.

### Functional Requirements (Legacy)
- Persona definitions with responsibilities and handoffs.
- Stage sequencing for content planning, production, and publication.
- Inventory tracking to avoid duplicate lessons and maintain coverage.
- Monitoring to watch official documentation and flag updates.
- Success metrics focusing on accuracy, engagement, and conversion.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Reusable prompts and instructions for the agent personas.
- Robust logging and tracking of decisions at each gate.
- Integration with GitHub Projects for stage tracking.
- SQLite database to store inventory and update reminders.

## Why Archived
- Meta-development scope clarified to exclude actual content production.
- Stage-gate workflow introduced to formalize approvals and deliverables.
- Specification now maintained through modular documents (agent prompts, validation checklist, governance playbooks).
