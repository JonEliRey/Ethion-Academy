# Working Notes: Excel Data Analytics Course

## Context

- Build a self-paced YouTube-first "Excel Data Analytics" course that elevates traditional Excel analysts with Power Query and Power Pivot workflows.
- Lessons must stay short (8–15 minutes), reuse prior outputs, and culminate in a capstone proving end-to-end automation using World Wide Importers sample data.
- Deliverables include course/module/lesson scaffolding, dataset packaging guidance, and a clear handoff plan for recording/uploading to YouTube with GitHub-hosted materials.

## Research Log

- 2025-11-16 18:05Z — Reviewed `.github/instructions/global.instructions.md` and `.github/instructions/content.instructions.md` for naming, metadata, and documentation rules.
- 2025-11-16 18:10Z — Noted user delivery constraints: YouTube self-paced recordings, WWI dataset distribution via GitHub, capstone requirement, small lesson runtime, Power Query/Power Pivot emphasis.
- 2025-11-16 18:25Z — Created feature spec (`specs/003-excel-data-analytics-course/spec.md`) capturing requirements, pacing constraints, and WWI dataset expectations.
- 2025-11-16 18:40Z — Drafted course structure plan detailing five modules, lesson runtimes, dataset packaging, and capstone rubric for WWI scenario.

## Decisions

- Proceed with five-module structure culminating in WWI capstone and self-assessment rubric.
