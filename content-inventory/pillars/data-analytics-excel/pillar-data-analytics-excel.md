# Data Analytics with Excel

## Overview

Excel remains one of the most widely used tools for data analytics in business environments worldwide. This pillar focuses on transforming Excel users into proficient data analysts by mastering Excel's advanced analytics capabilities, particularly Power Query and Power Pivot.

**Target Audience**: Business analysts, data analysts, financial analysts, and professionals who work with data regularly and want to unlock Excel's full analytical power.

**Why This Pillar Matters**: 
- Excel is ubiquitous in business environments - over 750 million users worldwide
- Power Query and Power Pivot provide enterprise-grade data transformation and modeling capabilities
- These skills create a strong foundation before advancing to specialized BI tools like Power BI or Tableau
- Immediate career applicability - these are among the most sought-after skills for analyst roles

## Scope

This pillar covers:

### Core Competencies
1. **Data Connection and Import**: Connecting to various data sources (files, databases, web)
2. **Data Transformation**: Cleaning, reshaping, and preparing data using Power Query
3. **Data Modeling**: Building relationships between tables using Power Pivot
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Writing DAX formulas for calculations and measures
5. **Visualization and Reporting**: Creating interactive dashboards and reports
6. **Automation Basics**: Understanding refresh workflows and light automation

### Tools Covered
- **Microsoft Excel** (365, 2021, 2019)
- **Power Query** (Get & Transform)
- **Power Pivot** (Data Model)
- **DAX** (Data Analysis Expressions)
- **Power Automate** (light introduction only)

### Out of Scope
- Basic Excel features (assumed as prerequisites)
- VBA programming (separate pillar)
- Power BI Desktop (separate pillar, but positioned as natural next step)
- Advanced statistical analysis beyond business analytics

## Learning Paths

### 1. Excel Data Analytics: Power Query and Power Pivot
**Status**: In Development  
**Target**: Beginners to intermediate Excel users  
**Duration**: 12-15 hours  
**Path ID**: `path-excel-data-analytics-power-query-and-power-pivot`

Complete journey from basic data manipulation to advanced analytics and modeling with Excel's modern features.

**Key Outcomes**:
- Extract and transform data from multiple sources
- Build data models with proper relationships
- Create DAX measures for business metrics
- Design interactive analytical dashboards
- Apply best practices for maintainable solutions

## Prerequisites

To begin this pillar, learners should have:
- Basic Excel proficiency (formulas, worksheets, basic functions like SUM, AVERAGE)
- Understanding of business data concepts (customers, sales, products)
- Familiarity with common data formats (CSV, Excel files)
- No programming experience required

## Leader's Lens

> **For Decision Makers**: Understanding the business impact of Excel analytics mastery

### Business Outcomes
- **Self-Service Analytics**: Reduce dependency on IT/data teams for routine analytical tasks
- **Faster Insights**: Transform data into insights in minutes rather than hours/days
- **Data Quality**: Standardized, repeatable data transformation processes reduce errors
- **Cost Efficiency**: Leverage existing Excel infrastructure without additional BI tool costs

### Decision Criteria
When considering Excel for analytics versus other tools:
- **Scale**: Excel excellent for datasets under 1 million rows; consider alternatives for larger volumes
- **Collaboration**: Power BI or other platforms better for team-wide dashboards and sharing
- **Complexity**: Excel ideal for departmental analytics; enterprise-wide analytics may need dedicated BI platform
- **Skills**: Most employees already familiar with Excel interface - lower training costs

### Risk Factors
- **Governance**: Spreadsheet proliferation can create data governance challenges - implement naming conventions and storage standards
- **Version Control**: Multiple versions of analysis files can cause confusion - use OneDrive/SharePoint with version history
- **Performance**: Large models can be slow - teach optimization techniques and know when to scale to other tools

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Adoption**: Percentage of analysts using Power Query vs. manual data preparation
- **Time Savings**: Reduction in time spent on repetitive data tasks (target: 50%+ improvement)
- **Data Quality**: Decrease in data errors and inconsistencies (track error rates in reports)
- **Skill Development**: Number of team members certified or proficient in Power Query/Power Pivot

## Content Strategy

### Delivery Formats
- **YouTube**: Primary video lessons (8-15 minutes each)
- **Blog Posts**: Written summaries and deep-dives on specific techniques
- **Academy**: Full course with exercises, quizzes, and certification (planned)
- **GitHub**: Sample data, exercise files, and code snippets

### Sample Data
**World Wide Importers**: Microsoft's production-quality sample database adapted for Excel learning
- Sales transactions and order data
- Customer and supplier information
- Inventory and product catalogs
- Realistic business scenarios

### Content Freshness
Excel features evolve with monthly updates (Microsoft 365). Content review schedule:
- **Quarterly Review**: Check for new Power Query/Power Pivot features
- **Annual Update**: Major refresh of examples and screenshots for UI changes
- **On-Demand**: Update when Microsoft announces significant feature changes
