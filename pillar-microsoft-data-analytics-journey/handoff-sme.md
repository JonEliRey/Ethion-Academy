# SME Handoff – Microsoft Data Analytics Journey

## 🔄 HANDOFF REQUIRED

**From**: Content Strategist  
**To**: @sme  
**Reason**: Technical validation of the Microsoft Data Analytics Journey pillar scope, governance framing, and demand evidence.

### Context

Over the last iteration we finished quantitative + qualitative research (search trends, job postings, community threads, competitor audits) and logged everything in `Research/microsoft-data-analytics-journey-notes.md`. Using that evidence we drafted the full pillar specification in `pillar-microsoft-data-analytics-journey/pillar-microsoft-data-analytics-journey.md`, emphasizing Excel → Power BI → Fabric transitions, Purview-backed governance, and adoption metrics.

The spec now includes detailed included/excluded topics, target personas, key outcomes, tooling coverage, related pillars, source citations, market signal summaries, and a phased content strategy. We need SME confirmation that the technical scope (Fabric architecture, governance checkpoints, migration sequencing) is accurate, that no critical Microsoft capabilities are missing, and that the demand signals are sufficient to justify investment.

### Deliverables Attached

- `pillar-microsoft-data-analytics-journey/pillar-microsoft-data-analytics-journey.md`
- `pillar-microsoft-data-analytics-journey/README.md`
- `Research/microsoft-data-analytics-journey-notes.md`

### What @sme Should Do

1. Review the pillar spec to confirm the technical accuracy of scope, tooling coverage, and governance guidance.
2. Validate that prerequisites/complementary pillars make sense for learner progression; flag any missing dependencies (e.g., Azure fundamentals, SQL modeling).
3. Confirm demand evidence strength—call out any signals that require additional sourcing or fresher data.
4. Provide acceptance or detailed revision notes so we can iterate before Executive Producer review.

### Expected Output

- SME feedback recorded inline (comments or tracked edits) or summarized in a short response referencing file paths/sections.
- Explicit approval statement or list of required changes.

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Scope covers all critical Microsoft analytics/fabric governance topics without gaps or overreach.
- [ ] Target audience and outcomes align with realistic learner prerequisites.
- [ ] Sources and demand evidence are deemed sufficient and current.
- [ ] SME either approves or documents actionable revisions blocking approval.

**Executive Producer**: Please switch to `@sme` with the files above for technical validation once the SME acknowledges this handoff.
