I think my new campaign should be about how we (data proffesionals) add value beyond creating reports. Specially in the era of AI, Data is going to become more valuable than ever. Since AI runs as much on data, as cars run on Fuel. Just like putting the wrong type of fuel or contaminated fuel in your vehicle would destroy it, no matter how good quality the vehicle is. putting  bad data in your AI or BI systems may get you moving, but it won't be long before your engine in clogged and your are going nowhere fast.  

My next campaign should focus on the data professional and giving them my perspective that their skills and demand will be much more relevant, now that we need to feed AI. Plus the prior demand of the business. 

However, with that being said, not all business will adapt at the speed necessary to succeed. Those still hoping to perform all tasks in-house will be faced with increased challenges as they try to diversify their knowledge into areas where others are engaging with outside experts. Just like the area of the conglomerate passed and gave way to organizations that focus on their competitive advantage and did that, very well. those that succeed will be the ones looking at identifying and focusing on what they do best, and leveraging trusted partners to perform what they do best.
